Erosion is defined as the movement of rock, soil, mud, or other ground components due to water, wind, or gravity. Erosion is a natural occurrence that can contribute to the health of an ecosystem— however, human land use or severe weather conditions often cause erosion to happen at a rapid speed.

In order to prevent this from happening, many Texas residents and organizations practice “erosion control.” This is usually done by creating a barrier (such as trees, flowers, or rocks) to absorb some of the force causing the erosion, thus allowing the soil to stay in place.

When water is the source of erosion, people often create what is called “embankment stabilization.” There are several ways to do this, but here are a few of the most popular solutions:

Rip rap- Rip rap is usually composed of large rocks placed along a shoreline to prevent water erosion. Rocks are carefully chosen based on their size and course, angular shape. This allows the rocks to naturally interlock, therefore absorbing a good deal of the pressure created by the ebb and flow of a body of water.

Gabions- Named from Gabionne, the Italian word meaning “Big Cage,” Gabions are used to line a shore in order to prevent water erosion. They are essentially caged rip rap that are easily stack-able and can be shaped into retaining walls, flood-walls, or even small dams. Often they become sturdier over time as silt and sand fill in the gaps between rocks, thus reinforcing the structure.

Revetments- Revetments are composed of 3 layers: an armor layer, a filter, and a toe. The armor layer is mainly composed of rip rap of varying sizes. An engineer should decide what sizes to use based on wave height and force. The filter layer allows water to move through the structure, and it consists of a special filter fabric called a geo-textile. The toe is located at the bottom of the structure where it provides support and anchorage while minimizing movement.

These can all be very effective tools when it comes to curbing erosion, and best of all the solution is natural and sometimes very beautiful as well.
