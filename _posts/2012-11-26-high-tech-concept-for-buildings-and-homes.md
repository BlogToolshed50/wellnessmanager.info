What if there were a skin that could just be zipped over buildings in the city and convert them into &#8220;green&#8221;, energy efficient buildings that use solar energy for the bulk of their power? If that sounds like science fiction, its about to become science fact.

Architectural 3D modeling, design, and rendering firm studio form work has indeed designed a &#8220;solar skin&#8221; to be fitted over buildings in order to enable them to absorb solar energy and transform it into electrical power. This could save people tremendous amounts of time and headaches when they attempt to figure out how to renovate their old buildings. Why not just wrap a second skin around them instead, at least for the time being? This could be especially valuable in handling the energy makeover of older buildings in cities.

These eye-shaped, efficient and affordable, 4 feet by 2.5 feet panels of lightweight, inflatable foam and polymer tubing are lined with thin film solar cells which are printed on Mylar. Every one of the configurable panels, which can simply be zipped together with other panels to create a waterproof seal of the needed size, is lined with high-density foam and finished with a white resin. The eye-shaped panels are actually &#8220;solar mirror parabolic eclipse polymer collectors&#8221; and there are steel cables within the tubing. Besides wrapping around existing buildings, the skins can be zipped together in a kind of tent for temporary shelter.

The skins are less expensive than traditional solar panels and can be used either as permanent or as merely temporary coverings for new or older buildings. They have been designed not only for high efficiency and cost-affordability but also to be aesthetically pleasing. Studio form work is combining art with renewable energy engineering.
