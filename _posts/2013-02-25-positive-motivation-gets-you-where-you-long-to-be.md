Many of you want your life to change. However, sometimes that&#8217;s as far as it goes.

You desire personal development but don&#8217;t get motivated towards doing anything to change. Unless your thoughts are put into action, nothing will be achieved.

You may hear yourself make excuses. &#8220;I really want to change, but i&#8217;m too busy to do anything about it&#8221;, or, &#8220;I probably wont be any good at it anyway, so why bother.&#8221; Unfortunately it&#8217;s all too easy to make excuses to not get motivated.

You have become trapped in your comfort zone! Your comfort zone makes you feel secure, and if you stay there you know you will be safe and that nothing will happen to make you feel any different. Of course your thoughts are correct. However staying in this place of comfort is of no benefit to your personal development. If you want to improve yourself you have to be brave and step out of your comfort zone and start to live your life in the way you dream.

It&#8217;s not easy to change, but if you spend time doubting yourself before you even try, not much is going to be achieved. If you really desire to change the way you are, you have to believe that you can. Not only can, but that you will, change.

You do have the ability to make your life the way you want it to be, but only if you believe this is possible.
  
The way you see yourself is important. If you think you aren&#8217;t very clever, or not particularly good at anything, this is the way you will be, because these thoughts have been programmed into your subconscious.

So what can you do about this? Change the way you see yourself. Start telling yourself that you are clever, you are capable, that you can do this.
  
Repeat positive statements to yourself about whatever area of life you want to improve. Re-program your thoughts until your subconscious accepts this information.

If you tell your subconscious something often enough it will believe what it is told.

You may have negative self talk without even realizing. Start to re-program your thoughts by telling yourself good positive information about whatever it is that you hope to improve.

Listen as you speak, you may be surprised at how often your self talk is negative. Each time you become aware of this negative thought, turn it into a positive one.

Each day tell yourself you can and will succeed. Repeat this as often as you can. Make all your thoughts about you, and what you are going to achieve, positive.

If you stay determined and don&#8217;t give in you will definitely begin to feel a change in yourself and start to see an improvement in your life.

If your self talk is positive you will reap the benefit in the way you desire.
