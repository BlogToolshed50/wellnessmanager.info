Gobar gas is one of the alternate energy source that identified from the cow dung. It is extensively popularized in the rural area in Asian countries. The gas is nothing but the methane gas produced when the dung from the cattle is fermented in a closed chamber built with local materials like mud and stones. Such plants are scientifically also built with proper layout and design to improve the efficiency. The gas emanated is used mainly in cooking in the rural area as a substitute for the fire wood.
