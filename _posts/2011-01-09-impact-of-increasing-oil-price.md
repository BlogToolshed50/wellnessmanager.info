Alternative to the Oil is the main agenda in the research portfolio of every nation as the cost of oil is escalating day by day. The environmentalists are also worried over the unabated pollution level due to the increased use of the hydro carbon. When the economy is expected to grow in countries like USA, China, India and Japan, the demand for the oil is bound to look up leading to the increased price. The continued exploitation of this wealth to produce the energy may result in depletion in a short span of time and the world need to look for the alternative.

The recent thinking worldwide is to go in for the electrification of the vehicles to a greater extent with a view to save oil and the environment. Many leading companies like Nissan and GM are embarking on the research to develop efficient batteries that can run the car and other vehicles without any hassle. Once the battery technology is stabilized, most of the car manufacturers can switch over to the electric cars to reduce the dependence on the hydro carbon source. The increasing oil price has driven the inflation sky high in many countries and it has led to the social unrest due to the spiraling price. It is better that sincere effort is put forth to ensure improvement in this arena to save the humanity.
