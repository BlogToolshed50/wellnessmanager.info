Personality is the sum total of the ways in which an individual reacts to and interacts with others. It is most often described in terms of measurable traits that a person exhibits.

Personality Determinants
  
An adult’s personality is generally considered to be made up both hereditary and environmental factors, moderated by situational conditions.

Heredity Heredity refers to those factors that were determined at conception. Physical stature, facial attractiveness gender, temperament, muscle composition, and reflexes, energy level, and biological rhythms are characteristics that are generally considered to be either completely or substantially influenced by who your parents were, that is, by their biological, physiological, and inherent psychological make up.

Tree different streams of research lend some credibility to the argument that heredity plays an important part in determining an individual personality. The first look at the genetic underpinning of human behavior and temperament among young children. The second address the study of twins who were separated at birth. The third examines the consistency in job satisfaction over time and across situation.

Environment Among the factors that exert pressures on our personality formation are the culture in which we are raised, our early conditioning, the norms among our family, friends, and social groups, and other influences that we experience. The environment which we are exposed plays substantial role in shaping our personality.

For example, culture establishes the norms, attitudes, and values that are passed along from the generation to the next and create consistencies over time.

Situation A third factor, the situation, influences the effects of heredity and environment on personality. An individual’s personality, although generally stable and consistent, does change in different situations.

It seems only logical to suppose that situations will influence an individual&#8217;s personality, but a neat classification scheme that would tell us the impact of various types of situations has so far eluded us. Apparently we are not yet close to the developing a system for clarifying situations so they might be systematically studied. How ever we do know that certain situations are more relevant than others in influencing personality.

Personality Traits
  
The early work on the structure of personality revolved around attempts to identify and label enduring characteristics that describes an individual behavior. Popular characteristics include shyness, aggressiveness, submissiveness, laziness, ambition, loyalty, and timidity. These characteristics, when they are exhibited in a large number of situations, are called personality traits.

In the recent years, an impressive body of research supports that five basic dimensions underlie all others and encompass most of the significant variation in human personality.

1. Extroversion This dimension captures one&#8217;s comfort level with relationship. Extroverts tend to be gregarious, assertive, and sociable. Introverts tend to be reserved, timid, and quiet.

2. Agreeableness This dimension refers to an individual&#8217;s propensity to defer to others. Highly agreeable people are cooperative, war, and trusting. People who score low in agreeableness are cold, disagreeable, and antagonistic.

3. Conscientiousness This dimension is a measure of reliability. A highly conscious person is responsible, organized, dependable, and persistent. Those who score low in this dimension are easily distracted, disorganized, and unreliable.

4. Emotional stability This dimension taps a person&#8217;s ability to withstand stress. People with positive emotional stability tend to be calm, self-confident, and secure. Those with highly negative scores tend to be nervous, anxious, depressed, and insecure.

5. Openness to experience The final dimension addresses an individual&#8217;s range of interest and fascination with novelty. Extremely open people are creative, curious, and artistically sensitive. Those at the other end of the openness category are conventional and find comfort in the familiar.
