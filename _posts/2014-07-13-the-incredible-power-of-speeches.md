Speeches have incredible power, and this can be seen from numerous events that have occurred in the past.

Recently we have seen the election of the first &#8220;black&#8221; president in the USA, Barack Obama. Surely he was elected for his integrity and vision, along with a host of other good qualities and promises made to the country he now leads. But what piled up his votes the most were his awesome, thought-provoking and well-delivered speeches, broadcast on international news and giving the world a sneak peak into his mind.

Indeed this is one of the many powers of great speeches; they give us a brief look into the thoughts, or way of thinking, of the person delivering the speech. Perhaps the most famous of all is the &#8220;I have a Dream&#8221; speech by Martin Luther King. One of the reasons for its lasting impression is that it not only gave the world a look into the thoughts of one man, but it showed everyone what was in the hearts of many people, except that he was able to verbalize and conceptualize those feelings and effectively communicates them.

Speeches have always held the incredible power to sway the minds of the masses. In George Orwell&#8217;s &#8220;Animal Farm&#8221;, it is the pigs&#8217; regular speeches which grant them the power they have over the rather ignorant farm animals. We hope that our leaders do not play upon our ignorance, but it is in this way that speeches will continue to hold this incredible power to sway the thoughts of many with simple words.

Given the power of speeches, it is in everyone&#8217;s best interest to develop their public speaking skills and learn the top communication tips. While the examples in this article have reflected in the impact of speeches on a very high level, the same impact can be achieved at any speaking occasionâ€”regardless of its pomp and circumstance. Thus, for your next business meeting, school presentation, or holiday dinner, be prepared and use your words effectively to fully take advantage of the opportunity.
