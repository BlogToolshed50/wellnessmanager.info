Books and children should go hand in hand. There are just about as many different books as there are different children. Variety is what everyone needs even children! Here are a few fabulously written electronic children&#8217;s books from authors who are sure to become favorites in your household.

FLY & I by Bonnie Covel and a book that teaches children about reputations, trust, friendship, kinship, and the importance of honesty through the sport of basketball. It is full of positive messages, and fun characters. Another creative book that teaches children an important lesson is IN A PARROT&#8217;S SHOES by Mindy Wilson. It is a story that any child or adult can relate to. The main character does not like being like everyone else she likes being unique. When a friend from class starts to mimic (parrot) everything she does, she seeks advice from her mother. Soon the little girl opens her heart and mind and she soon begins to appreciate her friend&#8217;s differences.

If your child likes to hear folktales, then STONE SOUP by Alistair Scott is the book you need. This adorably illustrated and well-written storybook for children will delight its readers. The main character is Tyler, a starving tramp (homeless man).

Do you read books to your children mainly at bedtime? Then THE EIGHTEEN STORY GINGERBREAD HOUSE by Jay Dubya would make a wonderful book to read them, as it is a collection of eighteen exceptional stories in a wide range of subjects.
