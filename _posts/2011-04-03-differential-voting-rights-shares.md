When the forcible take over of a company by cornering the shares from the secondary market is attempted by certain vested interest, companies had found out the way out globally to arrest this menace through the DVR route. The Differential voting Right shares are issued to the ordinary shareholders who are vested with the special voting rights to avert the forcible take over of the companies, which is detrimental to their interest. Many leading companies globally followed this method to safeguard the company and the shareholders. Most popular companies like Google, Ford motors and much more companies used this idea.

In addition to the special voting rights, the shareholders get better return by subscribing to the Differential Voting Rights share. The company can easily dilute the equity without matching the dilution in the promoters stake. DVR shares can be used to thwart the hostile takes over since, for all practical purposes, they decouple economic interest, dividend rights and voting rights. Shares with DVR rights are mainly targeted at the passive investors. They invest only for the economic returns when they invest in a company and are not interested in running the company or take over the management.
