Want to know a cure for bad breath? Bad breath is not only a health problem, but a social one as well. It is an embarrassment for anyone to have. But should you be suffering from bad breath, rest assured that there are cures for bad breath that are safe, natural, and effective. Specific cures for bad breath depend on the cause.

What causes bad breath?

Bad breath is usually caused by bacteria in the mouth, particularly on the surface of the tongue. It can be caused by poor dental hygiene, mouth infections, dryness of the mouth, stress, and external factors like cigarettes, smoke and coffee, among others. Less common causes of bad breath are stomach and intestinal problems, respiratory tract infections, and major body illnesses like diabetes and liver diseases.

If you feel you have bad breath, your doctor or dentist may help you identify the cause. This is helpful especially if you have halitosis, or chronic bad breath.

How to cure bad breath

Conventional cures for bad breath are antiseptic mouthwashes and medications. However, some of the best remedies for bad breath can be found in nature or in your home.

Cure For Bad Breath # 1: Mint oil is in!
  
You see mint in almost every breath-freshening product but the most effective and potent of all to use is arguably the peppermint oil â€“ yes, that essential oil usually used for aromatherapy. A drop of that pure essential oil on the tongue can freshen your breath quickly and naturally.

Also helpful is tea tree oil, a powerful antiseptic normally recommended for skin problems. As this oil is quite strong, just drop a very small amount on your toothbrush and brush your teeth with it.

Cure For Bad Breath # 2: Spice is nice. Seeds, too!
  
While some spices like pepper can make your mouth hot (and for some, smell unpleasant), a few like cloves actually have an antiseptic effect on the mouth and are a good remedy for bad breath. You can chew on cloves or grind them and prepare them as tea.

The seeds normally used as condiments like fennel and anise seeds are good breath sweeteners. Anise, in particular, has curative properties and kills odor-causing bacteria. Since these seeds are dry and can keep for quite some time, they are convenient to carry around with you. Simply chew on them after a meal.

Cure For Bad Breath # 3: Cool off with a lemon.
  
Not only is lemon good for lemonade and as a household cleaning agent, it is great natural cure for bad breath as well! Suck on a slice of lemon and feel your breath cleansed and freshened instantly.
