If the front of your fridge is already carrying more of your kid’s artwork than it can handle, then maybe its time to find some new outlets for their artistic creations. An art set can make a great gift for a child of any age, but helping your kids find productive ways to use one can be a bit of a challenge. Kids are often drawn to the idea of creating things with an art set, but seem to have some trouble executing their ideas into reality. You can help them by presenting some concrete ideas and giving them simple projects that they can complete themselves. The sense of satisfaction that they will have after completing a project will be immeasurable.

Making Gifts

Though the art set may have been a gift, it can also be used to make gifts. When it comes time to remember birthdays for grandparents, teachers, or family friends, getting your kids involved in making gifts has several benefits. First, it gives children a real sense of ownership over the gift. You may be able to help them with some basic ideas in order to get started, but as they get going, their own creative processes will take over. Second, a present made with care by a child often ends up being a prized possession of the recipient. The thoughtfulness behind a child’s art project is a gift that will last much longer than a new necktie.

Murals

If you really want to let your kids add their own flavor to their playroom, then designate some space on the walls for them to create a mural. Help them plan what the space will look like, and use the opportunity as a chance to show them how to design and to use space effectively. The contrasting spaces that the kids will naturally create will help make the room uniquely theirs.

Host your own Gallery Opening

The next time you have guests over, help your kids set up a small gallery of their art projects. You can use the playroom or a hallway for the artistic event. Let the kids invite guests to view their work and help them with the ability to explain each piece. Your guests will find that this is entertaining and will probably give your kids more encouragement and praise than you ever could have imagined. Not only is this a great way to use an art set, but it is a great way to fuel your kid’s creative fire.

Decorate Plain Toys

You can purchase plain wooden toys fairly inexpensively. At first, your kids may complain because the toys don’t have any bright colors or flashing lights, but once they realize that you are going to help them use their art set to decorate/paint their new toys then they will be ecstatic. This is an excellent way to encourage kids to use their imaginations as they can add any number of features and characteristics to each toy. The possibilities are only as big as their dreams.
