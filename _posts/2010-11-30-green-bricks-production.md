In the present situation, go green is need for every one of us to take a step to reduce the usage of energy level as well as avoid global warming. Green Bricks production is attempted to reduce the level of energy consumption. China stands number one in the matter of production of bricks that are used in the construction industry. At the same time, ecological imbalance created by the brick production is causing concern among the environmentalists as this sector burns lots of coal and wood leading to the greenhouse emission. Latest technology is attempted to reduce the dependence on the conventional source to burn the bricks to reduce the pollution. Modern brick kilns operated with electrical oven are found to be less polluting.
