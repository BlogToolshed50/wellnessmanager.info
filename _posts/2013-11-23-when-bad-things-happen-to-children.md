As parents we want to protect our children from being hurt, from pain, and from difficult situations. We all know this is impossible. What is “bad”? Bad is all in a continuum. How “bad” or traumatic a difficult situation turns out depends on the child’s temperament, family resources, coping mechanisms, support, character development, age and environment. Children might experience death of a family member, divorce, relocation, bullying, death of a pet, fighting with friends, failing in school, frustrations, loosing a game, being lost in a crowd, not fitting in… and the list goes on. We can’t protect them, but we can help them deal with it.

Children are more resilient than what most adults give them credit for. They understand more than we think, and perceive the world differently from us. My main advice for parents is TALK TO YOUR CHILDREN. Day after day I hear parents debating whether to tell the children of the impending move, the divorce or the illness. Some examples are finding another turtle to replace the one that just died “before they notice”. If children are not given the right information, accurately and age appropriately, they will fill in the gaps alone. One of the most difficult things for children to handle is secrets, ambiguities and conflicting messages from adults. Secrets place undue responsibility on children; secrets create conflict and lead to false conclusions. What a child does not understand or fully comprehend will not disappear from their mind. They will answer their own questions, fill in the missing information and create their own story. Here is when the problems begin: the headaches, stomach aches, fears, unexplained worry, and isolation to name some of the symptoms that appear.

If you, your family, a friend of your child is experiencing a difficult situation get informed. Seek information, consult experts, and explain to the children in a developmentally appropriate way what is going on. They are sensing it, reading body language, listening to bits and peaces of information. Allow room for crying, questioning, anger and conversation. You are giving them a gift, letting them know you are there, for protection, for guidance, for support and for answers. Let them know they can count on you. You are the adult and the person in charge. Please remember, it is always better to know the truth than live with a lie.
