Post harvest technology is becoming more important in the context of increasing demand for the food materials. It is estimated that as much as 30% of the total food produced is wasted in the absence of proper and appropriate post harvest technology to preserve the products . In the case of fruit crops the wastage is too much as they are perishable in nature. Likewise the flower that is harvested is to be properly preserved to have longer life. Recently the agricultural departments in various countries are coming out with chemical and biological treatment of the harvested crops to prevent them from deteriorating fast.

Cold storage is a vital and very useful post harvest technique that is predominately used. Vegetables like potato and chillies are seasonal crops that are used more frequently in the human diet. If proper storage facility is not there they are bounds to get damaged easily and become waste. Hence, cold storage are created with moderate temperature to maintain the harvested vegetables in fresh form for a longer period. Fruits like Apple is also put in the cold storage which takes care of the regular availability of seasonal fruits even during the non seasonal time.
