We have all heard of renewable energy. Renewable energy is derived from natural sources that are not used up, destroyed, or diminished in the process of generating power. There are essentially four types of renewable energy, Solar (the Sun), Geothermal (heat from within the Earth), Hydro (water), and Wind. Depending on where you live, you can utilize one, or more, of these renewable energy resources. The simplest to harness and use, however, is wind. 

Wind power and hydroelectric power are very similar in principle. One uses wind, the other water, as a driving force to create kinetic energy which is used to power a generator which then creates electricity. I know what you are thinking, but it really is much simpler than it sounds. 

A basic wind turbine has three parts: Rotor blades, a shaft, and a generator. The rotor blades catch the wind creating a drag or pulling which causes the blades to rotate the shaft. This action transfers energy from the wind into kinetic energy. Kinetic energy is the energy of motion. Any object in motion has kinetic energy. When the blades rotate, they cause the shaft to turn, or rotate, as well. The action of the shaft rotating transfers the mechanical energy into the generator. Generators operate on the principle of electromagnetic induction. When magnets are rotated around a conductor, they generate electricity. 

So the blades catch the wind, turning the shaft, which causes the generator to work, which creates electricity. It really is that simple

You can use wind turbines whether you are on grid or off grid. Depending on the system you get you can generate 50% to 100% of your electricity. A wind turbine capable of producing enough electricity to power the average household in the United States costs between $6,000 and $20,000, plus installation &#8211; or you could make your own.

The primary advantages are the same whether you buy or make your own wind turbine &#8211; you are using wind power to generate some or all of your electricity. However, making your own system can save you $5,800 to $19,800, plus installation depending on the system you would have bought. You can do everything yourself in a weekend or two, except you will need a licensed electrician to tie your wind turbine into your home&#8217;s power supply, if you choose to do so. An alternative to tapping into your home power supply is to get a simple and inexpensive power inverter that you can simply plug your home appliances into directly.

Building your own wind turbine does not have to be a difficult task. You can try to figure it all out on your own, grabbing bits of information using online research, or you get a complete guide that instructs you every step of the way. You probably won&#8217;t want to make mistakes, so having one of these guides is highly recommended. There are many to choose from.

Using renewable energy sources to offset or eliminate your electricity costs does not have to be complicated or expensive. Additionally, most of these guides explain how you can use materials that are reclaimed and recycled from construction sites. The rest of the materials can be found at your local hardware store. Thanks to these great innovators, wind power is not just for the very wealthy anymore. Now anyone who can follow simple instructions can have their own wind power.
