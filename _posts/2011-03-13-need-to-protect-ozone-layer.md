Ozone Layer is the most vital and protective layer that surrounds the earth. It is a thin layer of Ozone gas that is making a layer around the planet to protect the living and non living things form the scorching sun. If the Ozone layer is not there, the earth will be affected by the direct sun rays which may wipe off the entire living things. Due to the increasing technological advancement the release of chemicals into the atmosphere is on the rise. This has affected the Ozone layer leading to the compulsion to find the ways and means to protect the layer intact.
