The physical and mental changes can create doubts and incomprehension and can change ideals; each young person reacts to this stage of life in his/her own way, according to his/her personality and his/her past experiences. Adolescence a very difficult stage of life in which many transformations happens in the mind and the body of a boy or girl. In the meantime, the child&#8217;s social role is abandoned in order to acquire a new role in adult life.

The transition from child to adult is difficult for teenagers also. So many changes occur in these short years that it is not surprising that they feel at times confused, frightened and lacking in confidence. Physically, their bodies grow and change in ways that might make them feel awkward and self-conscious. Emotionally, they can be subject to great mood swings as they discover the range of human emotions. From intense feelings of love and infatuation to anger and hatred, teenage emotional life can be like a roller coaster.

Physically, teenagers become fully developed and can experience intense sexual feelings that can be alarming to them, especially if they have no one to talk to about what is going on. Intellectually, teenagers also make great gains, being able to analyze things and to develop their own opinions and views. They can begin to see the inadequacies in the parental world (and often are very eloquent in pointing this out) and wonder about their role and meaning in life. Teenager are under pressures, some of which are greater than in previous years, and need the support of their parents more than ever

There are so many pressures on teenagers to be involved in drugs and alcohol or to become sexually active at too young an age. With their increasing independence, you can also fear for their safety, worrying that they might be attacked or placed in very unsafe situations.

. An interesting fact found in studies is that teens are more concerned about drinking and driving than are their parents. And the facts also show that the number one preventive measure is talking to teens. The simple practice of discussing issues such as drinking, drug use, and other high-risk behaviors has a significant impact on adolescent behavior. Start with young teens. Evidence shows that some teens begin experimenting with alcohol when in middle school. Some children as young as 8 or 9 report having tried alcohol. Parents who discuss alcohol use with their children in an informative manner and set guidelines and expectations for behavior can significantly impact their child&#8217;s tendency to experiment.

Educate your child about the risks and consequences of drinking. This doesn&#8217;t have to be a shouting match. Give your child materials that will teach them about the sad results of teens who have used and/or abused alcohol. Let them know you have a zero tolerance policy when it comes to illegal use of alcohol. Be sure you are not giving mixed messages by irresponsibly using alcohol yourself.

Sometime you feel that your teen is lying to you. You may find your child lied simply because they knew the behavior was wrong and they didn&#8217;t want to get caught. This will mean you need to let them know in very clear terms what behaviors are unacceptable and what the consequences will be, not only for repeating that behavior, but for lying about it.

Teaching respect for racial diversity

It&#8217;s important for parents and other professionals to work together with the child to solve the problem.

It&#8217;s important to never give up our educational role as parents, but is equally important to try and make teen ages understand the motivation of the advice (or prohibitions) we give them in order to let them feel understood and cared for.
