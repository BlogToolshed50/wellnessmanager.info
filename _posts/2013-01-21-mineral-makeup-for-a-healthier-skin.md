Mineral makeup is nothing new. In fact the Egyptians were using it over two thousand years ago. However it’s now back at a makeup counter near you bringing with it freshness, convenience and a much healthier skin.

As a doctor I know what damage some traditional makeup products can cause the skin if worn over time for prolonged periods without adequate cleansing. So the advent of mineral makeup to the cosmetic counters is a major breakthrough in healthy living and skincare.

Mineral cosmetics have their basis in ground-up minerals, including various metal ores and iron oxide. Being natural, they are allergen-free and contain no chemical dyes, added preservatives, fillers, perfumes, oils or talc – or other ingredients commonly found in traditional makeup products.

Mineral makeup contains only pure mineral pigments in concentrated form. Due to their concentration they perform the functions of concealer, foundation and powder &#8211; and incredibly all in a single application which binds to the skin so well that very little touch-up is required as the day progresses.

After mineral makeup is first applied – and this can be done very simply with a brush &#8211; the skin might appear a little powdery, but after a short time you will find that it is taken up very well by the natural oils within the skin.
  
And incredibly, you’ll find that by nighttime your face will look just as fresh as it did in the morning when the makeup was first applied, without shine or streaks.

Mineral makeup’s purity means that it works well with most skin types and you will find that it adds a day-long youthful sheen to your skin. But it also possesses several other benefits:

SUNSCREEN

Mineral foundation powders also contain zinc oxide and titanium dioxide that act as a reflective coating which blocks the harmful effects of the sun. In addition natural forms of Vitamins A and E are regularly added which have anti-oxidant benefits and also help prevent photo aging of the skin.

ANTI-ALLERGY

Since synthetic dyes, perfumes and preservatives are avoided in the composition of mineral makeup, there is little risk of skin sensitivity to the ingredients, resulting in a considerably reduced risk of longer-term allergic reactions.

EASY APPLICATION

Mineral makeup can be applied quickly and easily with a brush or sponge, and when applied to clean moisturized skin, it doesn’t smear or run. To immediately do away with the initial powdery effect, all you need to do is mist your face lightly even with ordinary water.

VERSATILITY

Due to it’s day-long enduring qualities, mineral makeup is not only ideal for those with hectic lifestyles, but it has also found favor in the film and tv industries. Plus, it is often provides a great solution for many with existing skin problems, such as those caused by burns.

Now let’s take a look at the cost. If you are used to cosmetic counter prices, you aren’t going to be totally shocked. However, you should also consider the savings you can make by using mineral makeup. What would you normally put on your face before venturing out in the morning? After a moisturizer, how about a primer? Then there are concealers, foundation, blusher, creams, powder…

However when using mineral makeup, after using a moisturizer, you’ll find that many products which were once a part of your daily regimen, now become totally redundant. So the overall savings could be quite significant. And think about the time saving too!

Modern mineral makeup represents a major advance not only in cosmetics but also in skincare and your overall well-being.
