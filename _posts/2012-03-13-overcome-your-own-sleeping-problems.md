Sleep is necessary for the body to function, grow, and heal after an injury. Most research findings recommend that grownups need from six to eight hours of sleep nightly. Many people, however, are unable to accomplish this. Approximately 20 million individuals who live in the United States alone experience serious difficulty sleeping every night.

A number of factors that cause sleeping problems are responsible for this startling statistic. For example, a significant number of people snore. Deep snoring may even cause sleepers to wake, startled, at the noise. Moreover, individuals who have a spouse that is a loud snorer sometimes find it difficult to sleep with such a racket happening in the same room!

Snoring can also be a symptom of a similar sleeping problem described as sleep apnea. This disorder can happen when an individual quits breathing in the middle of sleep. It may be a result of blockages in the nasal and sinus passages, or by being overweight. This problem can be deadly, and persons who are diagnosed with sleep apnea frequently wear a mask that sends pressured air to their lungs while they are sleeping.

Still another potentially dangerous sleeping problem is referred to as sleepwalking, but is sometimes described referred to in medical literature as somnambulism. People who sleepwalk perform the same behaviors &#8211; cleaning house, taking a shower, walking, &#8211; that they perform during their waking hours. Nearly 20 percent of the population worldwide may sleepwalk.

Sometimes, people have often documented cases of people who have left their homes or killed someone during a sleepwalking episode! Most frequently, however, the person who is asleep is in much more danger than the people nearby. The ideal alternative is to get the sleepwalker to return to bed.
