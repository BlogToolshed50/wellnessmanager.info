Nasal Congestion has the nuisance value and affects the normal breathing. The major reason for the nasal congestion is higher humidity level that is found in the atmospheric air. Usage of saline solution clears the congestion in the nasal canal. If the humidity level is between 35 to 45 % people will not have the nasal congestion problem as found in the latest research.
