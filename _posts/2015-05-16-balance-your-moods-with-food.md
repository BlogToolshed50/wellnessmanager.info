Here are some helpful hints on the nutrients you need to stay &#8220;emotionally fit&#8221; and help prevent mood-swings. These foods help keep you &#8220;hormonally&#8221; healthy &#8211; see Canada&#8217;s Food Guide to Healthy Eating to ensure that you get all of the nutrients needed to maintain a well-balanced diet for optimal overall health.

Before breakfast: 

Start your day with greens+â„¢, a balanced formula of 23 herbs, vitamins, minerals, organic and nutrient-rich foods to help boost motivation and energy levels. 

Breakfast:

This should include about one-third of foods that are high in lean protein such as eggs, grains or low-fat yogurt and two-thirds of low-density complex carbohydrates such as vegetables, fruits and whole grains. 

Mid-morning snack: 

Reach for some raw, very low-density complex carbo-hydrates such as carrots, celery or zucchini.

Lunch:

Eat a balanced lunch including lean protein such as chicken or fish with complex carbo-hydrates from veggies and leafy greens. 

Mid-afternoon snack:

Choose fresh fruit as a low-density complex carbohydrate snack to increase the level of serotonin in the body and help curb that 3 o&#8217;clock sugar craving. 

Dinner:

This should be high in complex carbohydrates and low in protein to provide enough serotonin to help calm hormones during the evening for a good night&#8217;s sleep.
