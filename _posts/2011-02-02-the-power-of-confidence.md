The power of confidence is that power which delivers the key to success in our life. As we know, the entire Cosmos including the sun, the moon the stars, various planets seem to be on a definite path powered by the unseen force. If all such unseen power fuels all the activities around our life, then the power of confidence makes our activities more meaningful, useful and successful. &#8220;The fool never begins a work for the fear of failure, the mediocre gives up in the middle frustrated by obstruction, but the man of confidence never gives up despite failure until he succeeds&#8221; Lack of confidence in oneself, ones organization, society, country and almost everything is a bane of the human society.

Confidence is not a gift from God. It has to be cultivated within yourself to meet the situations and challenges. In the words of Swamy Vivekananda, &#8220;All power is within you, you can do anything and everything. Believe in that and never believe that you are weak&#8221; The combination of qualities like, conviction, hard work, will power, preparation, communication, commitment and definite goal makes the person to develop the needed confidence. Man of confidence is always realistic, practical, ready to accept the changes and ready to listen to the experts and willing to learn. One can acquire this character by practice and learning and attempt to become the best in the life.
