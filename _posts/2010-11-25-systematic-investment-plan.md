Investment opportunity and the methods are in plenty in the market. Anyone has surplus can do it in the stocks, mutual funds and gold to increase the wealth. Of late, people tend to invest in SIP, which is the Systematic Investment Plan. It is found to be the simple and regular methods of participating in the stock market and bond market on a regular basis through the mutual fund.

In a recent article I read that the regular investment can be done every month in the mutual funds on an ongoing basis by debiting your account every month from your bank account by giving a standing instruction. The amount can be a minimum of 500 even every month. In case you are interested, you can even invest on a daily basis under SIP to get the return.

The SIP sounds as a good option for those who are getting monthly income and wants to increase the wealth without much risk. It can be done for a fixed period of three years also to gain more in the fluctuating market. Select a proper mutual fund investing in vital sectors based on their past record and return to invest under the SIP route.
