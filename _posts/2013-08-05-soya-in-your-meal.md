We all know hat Japanese live longer when to be compared to others in the world. Yes, they are reported to be taking Soya food regularly, but in a limited way. Since, Soya is a protein rich food it helps the human life in different ways provided it is taken at an optimum level. The zero level cholesterol present in Soya guards against the heart diseases. Most of the Japanese eat around 8gms to 10gms of soy protein daily to keep them fit as that is the optimum level that is needed by the body. It is a matter of surprise that excess dose of Soya in the food may lead to dread diseases like, cancer, dementia, osteoporosis and the more. Both men and women can have infertility problem due to excess consumption of Soya.

Increased consumption of Soya may enhance the total estrogen level in the women, which can result in the occurrence of breast cancer. Physical changes and hormonal havoc can also happen in the men if they take Soya beyond the prescribed limit. An amount of 25 to 30gms of Soya per day in our diet is found to be ideal with out affecting our health. In fact, the fermented Soya products such as miso-soups, temp-eh and Soya sauce are said to be more safe for consumption without any health issues. Hence, we should avoid the non fermented Soya items like, soy milk, tofu and the like. The high- level of physic acid in non fermented Soya products cause the health problems. We have to keep away from the soy supplements and the energy bars to the extent possible to live healthy.
