There comes a time in our life when we look back and realize that the days, weeks, months and years just seem to have flown by, we wonder what happened to our life. We intended to do great things with our life, what happened?
  
Well, I am here to tell you that it is never too late. The past is just that The Past, it can’t be changed. It’s the future that counts. What will we do with our future?

Something has to change, but what is it? What is it that you Desire? What is your Purpose? What are you willing to give to Make Your Dreams Realty?

The only person that can answer these questions is you. Even though you can’t change your past you must take inventory of what you’ve done to get you to where you are. Everyone has choices throughout their lives and the choices we made are what have brought us to where we are. Good or Bad, where we are in our lives is a direct outcome of our choices. The way we make the changes in our lives is first by excepting where we are. Learning from our mistakes and moving forward with a positive believe that we can accomplish great wealth, relationships are whatever we desire.

We each have the ability to create our own success, (success being, whatever success means to you). It’s not luck. It’s not magic. It’s what’s inside us.

Second Step, Changing your Believe System. What we believe is what we go by to make the choices that we make. Our Perceptions of situations in our life is the deciding factors in our choices. As I once heard Ellie Drake say “What we see is not always what is” In other words, is our perception of things really the way they are? A true step toward making the right decisions (choices) is to look at everything that happens as a positive, knowing there is a reason, looking for the positive in a seemed negative situation. Asking the question, why is this happening and what lessons can I learn from it.

Look deep within yourself to find the answer. If we learn to accept our challenges as a learning tool we can move forward without all the negative thoughts. We are what we believe, if we believe we can achieve our goals and dreams then we are inspired to take action toward making them happen, then we can becomes reality. If we believe that we can’t then that frame of mind will keep us from taking the necessary actions, which in turn will make our belief’s a reality.

Third step, taking the action, without a plan of action we have no direction. Have you ever tried taking a trip without knowing the direction in which to go to reach your destination? It would be impossible wouldn’t it? Then why do we leave our goals and dreams to chance without planning for them? Why do we aimlessly go through life without direction? Think of your goals and dreams as a trip. How many people take a trip without first planning for every aspect of that trip. How will I get there? How will I finance it? Where will I stay? What will I do when I get there? These are questions we must ask ourselves so that we can make a plan of action to reach our goals and dreams. What will it take to get to our desired destination? Make a Plan and take Action.

Fourth Step, finding the tool (transportation) that will get you there, if it’s Financial Freedom you desire find the something that you enjoy doing and it will be effortless. I’ve always heard “if you find that something you enjoy doing you never have to work another day in your life”. Now, this sounds like the way to go. Why work for someone else helping them achieve their dreams when you can work for yourself doing what you enjoy and creating that wealth for yourself? Just remember, the way to true wealth is reaching out and helping others. This way you’re not only creating financial wealth but you’re creating a wealth of friendships which is really the most important wealth we can create.

Fifth Step, Seeing yourself as already being there, after working through steps one-Four you should have a clear picture of what you want, believing you can get there, having the direction or a plan of action to get there and a tool (transportation) by which to get there. So, now all you have to do is picture yourself there. Live as though you are already there.

So, Accept where you are today, believe in yourself, take action by making a plan (find your direction), find the tool (transportation) to get you there and live as though you are there.
