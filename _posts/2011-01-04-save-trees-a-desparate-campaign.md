There is a sudden need to save trees and I feel that I and all of us must be more caring about our nature and the trees around. You really need to put your mind into making projects that help in conservation successful. I recently came across a wonderful organization named Power Vote that helps people to get awareness about saving trees and living an Eco-friendly life. I think this is really cool since we all really need to live with our environment and make sure that we save the world for our future generations. If you are thinking in this line too, then you really can take a step forward in helping and funding such organizations.

We need to save the medicinal value trees as well. Neem is one of the tree that has lots of medicinal value. The various parts are used differently to get varieties of benefits. The Neem leaves are used as organic manure in the field to protect the crops from many diseases. Neem powder has medicinal value and is used in the various formulations of human medicines. This herbal powder has lots of healing aspects with reference to the skin problems. Neem oil is added as an additive in the soap making industry. It is an essential oil.
