Even when teens start dating, they are still not as close with romantic partners as they are with their same-sex friends.

Parents and teens can live together more or less harmoniously if parents know what to expect and are willing to make some adjustments in the way they think and act.

Parents can be helpful by giving their teens tactful grooming tips and by encouraging them to look beyond themselves in some way perhaps by joining an interest group or taking up a new sport or hobby.
