Are you feeling sluggish and drained, or on top of the world? Our body has lost its ability to rejuvenate and revitalize itself with its natural life force energy due to the stressful lifestyle. Hence you should rectify your Body Ecology! Nourish the adrenals and the thyroid which are the two very vital glands in your body that define energy levels.

Sleep Early
  
&#8220;Early to bed and early to rise&#8221; is still true for our health. Our liver functions the best between 10 pm and 1 am. These are to allow your body to rest, be rejuvenated and regenerated to deal with a natural detox process.

Eat Natural Foods
  
Canned foods are unhealthy because they are processed using mono-sodium-gluconate. The chemicals in processed foods destroy body minerals.Our digestive systems over-work itself in order to digest the processed foods and this gives extra burden to our organs. On the other hand, Natural fresh and cooked foods contribute the nutrients the body needs and help to detox.

Avoid Caffeine
  
Drinking caffeine will dehydrate the body and intoxicate the blood with more acids and toxins rather than energy. Try some other vitality or energy drink instead of a caffeine drink to help energize the body and recover its ability to detox.

Avoid Smoking
  
Nicotine from cigarettes enters your blood stream and fills your lungs and makes respiration difficult, thus reducing the oxygen-intake and preventing circulation of oxygenated blood through the body. Clean, unpolluted air is essential for oxygenated blood to be circulated to help energize it.

Reduce Your Sugar Intake
  
It&#8217;s a myth that sugar can boost your energy. Breaking down of sugar to produce energy becomes a difficult and lengthy process. No-calorie sugar replacements and foods containing natural sugars as in fruits should be consumed instead to revitalize and give the body the natural energy it needs to detox.

Consuming Fermented Drinks and Foods
  
Fresh or packaged coconut drinks contain a lot of minerals and nutrients to help the digestive system process the foods we eat. Thus we get sufficient nutrients and vitamins in the body which in turn helps it recover its ability to detox.

Organic Foods
  
Foods grown organically are becoming more popular as they contain all the necessary minerals and nutrients. Food should not be overcooked or burnt as it loses its nutrients and minerals and does not help the body to re-energize. As far as possible the more raw or uncooked the food, the better digested and more strength and energy we get out of them.

Drinking More Than Sufficient Water
  
Lack of sufficient water in the body causes dehydration and fatigue and natural inability to detox. Having 2 glasses of water every morning help to keep the cellular function of the body active. This helps to flush out the toxins from the body, reduce fatigue and dehydration levels. Drink a large glass of water a half hour before lunch and dinner. This primes the intestines into digesting the food you eat. Water helps recover the body&#8217;s ability to naturally detoxify and cleanse itself.

Respect Your Body
  
With the right foods, plenty of water, exercise and corrective lifestyle, the body will detoxify in a natural way. You could also include colon cleansing either through naturopathy or do-it-yourself program. Detoxification process tends to tire one. But with rest you will feel better, and the body can recover its ability to detox. The most important thing is to rectify the lifestyle that is prevalent today.

Control Your Animal Protein Intake
  
Digestion takes a long time for animal proteins and the body burns a lot of energy in order to digest these foods. Thus it takes a long time to digest these animal proteins. They should be accompanied by sufficient greens and salads to help digest them faster.
