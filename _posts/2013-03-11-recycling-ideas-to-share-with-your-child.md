When time nears for a child to leave the nest, most parents feel both joy and dread. Many parents make that transition gracefully with the child who is not disabled. However, parents of children with dual sensory impairments or other severe disabilities are often confronted with issues they have never before considered. Although this can be a very stressful time, there is way to help make transition smoother. Even when a child is very young there are things that families can begin to do to plan for the future.

Draw up a will, plan your estate and write a Letter of Intent.
  
Plan for their child&#8217;s adulthood very early on.
  
Get to know adults with disabilities
  
Find out about support options which exist in your community
  
Learn to advocate for services you and your child will need in the future.

Be sure to separate recyclable materials into different categories like glass, paper, plastics and metals. Find out where you’re nearest recycling center is by looking in the phone book.
  
3) Plant a tree. Trees remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and produce oxygen that we need to survive.
  
4) Avoid using pesticides and other chemicals on your grass and yard. They are harmful to the water we drink, to kids who play on the lawn, and the animals that walk on it.
  
5) Hold garage sales or donate any old clothes or materials you have to charity
