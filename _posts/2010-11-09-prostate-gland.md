Prostate Gland is the vital organ in the human body. It is in the size of a walnut fruit. It is located under the bladder in the urinary tract. It is the storage point for the urine until it is urinated out from the human body. It is adjoining the tube through which the urine is passed. When the age of the human being crosses 60 years, the prostate enlarges. This puts pressure on the tube that is passing the urine from the storage point. Hence, the flow of the urine is restricted and it leads to certain other complications. So, timely check up the same is a must.
