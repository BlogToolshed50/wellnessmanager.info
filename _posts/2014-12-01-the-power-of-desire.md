You can give your child the best possible schooling, teach all the important techniques of success, encourage goal setting and set a fantastic example. But that is not enough! All these good things have one vitally important pre-requisite. Before you can achieve anything, you must know what you really, really want.

A burning desire is the first, most important and essential step towards any major achievement. As a parent, you are in a unique position to influence another person&#8217;s desires &#8211; your child&#8217;s. By the time they reach their teens, you will have lost this influence to a significant degree, as young adults are swayed much more by their peers&#8217; opinions than their parents&#8217;.

So make the most of the early years by instilling positive, beneficial desires in your children. The desire to do well academically could shape your child&#8217;s further education and career much more than her innate ability.

How can you instill desire? Telling stories is a great way. Children love stories! Be creative and tell stories where the hero or heroine has a burning desire for something, overcomes challenges and set backs, and achieves the desired outcome. Try telling stories where a child achieves academic success, which in turn results in something even more desirable. For instance, one story could tell of a child who has a burning desire to travel to the North Pole. She succeeds academically and thus wins an award, which makes her dream come true. Tailor the stories to your own child&#8217;s life and experiences as much as you can.

The famous author Napoleon Hill used story-telling to instill in his almost-deaf son both a burning desire to hear, and a firm belief that his disability would actually bestow upon him a great advantage (although at the time even his father had no idea what that advantage could be). By the time this boy left college, he had against the odds acquired a hearing aid that enabled him to hear clearly for the first time in his life. More remarkably, he had justified his father&#8217;s belief by securing a marketing position with the hearing aid manufacturer to bring the same benefit to millions of other deafened people.

&#8220;Gifted child&#8221;? Give your child the gift of self-esteem, and you will give him the gift of happiness.
