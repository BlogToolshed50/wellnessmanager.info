I say that whatever your problem is, it is also potentially and probably the start of your solution.

If you take on a higher awareness, your problem is solvable.

Albert Einstein said, “You cannot solve the problem at the level of the problem.” That means, metaphorically, on a ladder with ten steps on it, if your problem is on the first step, you must elevate your awareness, consciousness, or thinking to a higher level and look down on the problem with a mind that owns the solution to the problem.

The mother of the two children with CF in my previous article could have stayed on the first rung of the ladder and said, “Woe is me and my children. Nobody cares—not my husband, friends, government, or insurance company. I cannot do anything; so I will cry, moan, feel despondent, disconsolate, and depressed—and therefore be inactive, suffer, complain, blame, and feel awful.”

But what she did do is what I am sincerely recommending to you. SHE TOOK ACTION. She “did-the-do.”

Other parents who love their kids but are beleaguered by an enormous health challenge will often unite and be willing to learn a new skill like network marketing and selling and find their talents to meet the need and do-the-do.

Ralph Waldo Emerson said: “Do the thing and you’ll have the power to do the thing.” The mother thought about it, talked about it, got into it, and learned as she earned. She became the number-one product salesperson and number-one recruiter in the company in one year.

That was not her goal; her goal was her Big Why: I WILL SAVE MY CHILDREN. As her confidence, courage, ability, skills, talent, and successes grew, so did her earnings, leadership, and future opportunities. They did for her, and they will for you.

Be on fire and you will light up your down-line!
