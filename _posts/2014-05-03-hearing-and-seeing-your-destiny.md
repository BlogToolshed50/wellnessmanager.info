As a child, I read an autobiography of Annie Sullivan. She was the woman who brought Helen Keller out of her dark and silent world and into a place of understanding few of us in the hearing and seeing world fully grasp. I decided I wanted to become a teacher for people like Helen. I wanted to bring lightness and sound into people&#8217;s lives.

What did you want to do as a child? Remember how it felt to fully believe that you could be an astronaut, the President or Prime Minister, an Academy Award winning Actress, an Olympian?

Helen Keller made this suggestion to people as they worked towards making their goals real, and I would like to add a variation to her theme. &#8220;It is for us to pray not for tasks equal to our powers, but for powers equal to our tasks, to go forward with a great desire forever beating at the door of our hearts as we travel toward our distant goal.&#8221; I would assert one step further, that your goal not be in the distance, but rather be in each moment of each day. In choosing an overall life where your heart is in sync with your dreams and actions, the power and intention of each day creates an effect of natural movement towards the life of your dreams, a life of empowerment for you and those around you, a life mapped by your destiny.

Know that this is entirely possible for you, starting today. Instead of saying immediately, &#8220;Oh, I can&#8217;t do that! No way!&#8221; ask yourself instead, &#8220;How can I live my destiny?&#8221; I challenge you to take the first few simple steps. Begin integrating these into your life today and watch what unfolds in the process.

What if you believed completely that no task was too big for you to complete? Accept this as truth. There is nothing that is too big. Perhaps you will have to tweak or modify the specifics of your dream, but no specific task is impossible.

What if you let go completely of the scarcity and lack? How much does fear block you from your greatness? How often does your mind race immediately to &#8220;I can&#8217;t afford that&#8221; or &#8220;That price is more than I have&#8221; or &#8220;I will have to wait&#8221;? Relax in the knowledge and belief that you have everything that you need and more. Abundance is the truth. One step further, it is yours.

What if you embraced in your heart that each person you encounter is an equally magnificent creation? That means that you are as valuable as anyone else on the planet. You have a specific, unique purpose and destiny. From your core is a fountain or wellspring of possibilities. All you need to do is to stay grounded and focused on your daily goal or intention of a life in alignment with the callings of your life put into daily actions reflecting those callings.

You can do this. You are worth it. You are big enough, strong enough, sure enough, and have enough resources. Today! Here and Now!

In a world where she could neither see nor hear in conventional ways, Helen Keller opened a world of possibilities to the seeing world. Embrace her expansive vision, play a symphony to her ears. Go to your destiny.
