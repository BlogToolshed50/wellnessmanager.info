Serious people Beware! You are entering an area where your seriousness is under threat.

If seriousness is your forte, be alert to the symptoms of laughter that&#8217;s contagious. Run for cover as you feel your mouth corners twitch and unexpected giggles push themselves up continuously &#8211; sure signs you&#8217;re becoming addicted to laughter.

No! The laughter doesn&#8217;t stop there! Ever seen the rolling on floor emoticon? Holding the sides, down on the floor with tears rolling down the cheeks? That&#8217;s hitting the peak of laughter, and it is addicting, too.

John had a parrot. The parrot had a bad vocabulary and an equally bad attitude. John tried his best in all possible ways to teach the parrot to clean up its vocabulary. It only got worse with the parrot&#8217;s rude behavior.

Irritated by the parrot, John caught the yelling parrot and stuffed it into the freezer. There was silence.

Worried about the parrot, John pulled it out of the freezer. He was amazed to find the parrot on it&#8217;s best behavior, using completely appropriate language. John understood completely when the parrot quietly asked, &#8220;By the way, what mistake did the turkey make?&#8221;

Laughter makes us lose control of ourselves by retrieving our playfulness and innate sense of being light-hearted.

A heart patient won a billion dollars in the lottery, and his friend wanted to make sure the news was passed on to him slowly. He approached the heart patient and asked him, what would you do if you happened to win a billion dollars in the lottery? The heart patient stated that he would surely share it 50-50 with his friend. Shocked by the heart patient&#8217;s reply, his friend dropped dead!

There are three types of people in this world: those who make things happen, those who watch things happen, and those who wonder what happened. Needless to say, the heart patient belonged to the third category.

Is there any difference between humor and laughter? Humor is the cause of laughter and laughter is the effect of humor. Trigger your sense of humor to bring out the laughter. Humor is an intellectual capacity to perceive something funny, and laughter is a physical reaction to the stimulation of humor.

A Conversation between God and Man
  
Man: How much is a second for you?
  
God: a second equates to 10000 years
  
Man: What is penny equivalent to you?
  
God: a penny is one million dollars
  
Man (mischievously): I am poor so can you spare me a penny?
  
God: Why not? Give me a second.

Practical jokes live in memory and prank gifts make an ideal item for the young and the old. To play a practical joke or give a funny gift brings moments to cherish forever to those involved.

Laughter and humor help us fight stress by reducing anger and worries. Humor and laughter should be a part of everyday life &#8211; a way to bring back the natural smile that is often lost in our transition from childhood to adulthood. Let the child in yourself delight in the following statements made by children:

Nitrogen is not found in Ireland because it is not found in a free state.

When you breathe, you inspire. When you do not breathe, you expire.

Liter: A nest of young puppies.

Germinate: To become a naturalized German.

The tides are a fight between the earth and moon. All water tends towards the moon, because there is no water in the moon, and nature abhors a vacuum. I forget where the sun joins in this fight.
