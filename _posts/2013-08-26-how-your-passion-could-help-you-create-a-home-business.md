By now, you should know that any email or person that says starting a home business (Internet business) is a quick way to make millions of dollars overnight without any effort is just outright lying. Yes, you can make millions online with your own home business, but like anything of value, it&#8217;s going to take some work. So, it&#8217;s important that your create a home online business you&#8217;ll really love.

For me, it was my passion for trading stocks, so I created my online newsletter called Stocks2WatchÂ® in January of 1998 and I still publish it each night. Since that was back in the early days of Internet marketing, when there were no rules to follow, I had to do a lot of learning as I went along, resulting in some very long days. If I had not been so passionate about what I was doing, I would probably not be in business today.

Now, getting started with an online business is a lot easier and you will not have to work nearly as hard as I did (since you be getting fresh content here). But still, you want to wake up each morning excited to get to work on your home business.

So, how do you turn your passion into a viable online home business? We&#8217;ll explain that as we go along, but for now, start thinking about the things in your life that really get you excited and how you could translate them into a home business.

You&#8217;d be surprised. And the next thing to do is&#8230;.

&#8230;Find what&#8217;s called a &#8220;niche&#8221; market for your home business.

After you find some ideas about what you are passionate about, you need to be sure other people (potential customers) are passionate about them also, in order to create a profitable home business.

This niche market is a small, targeted group of people who share a specific interest. The more specific your niche is, the easier it will be to tailor your marketing messages to them.

You need to zero in on a specialty service or product that is generally not available through traditional retail channels. Your target market must be specifically identified and located online.

You must FOCUS. Not everyone will want your product, so focus your efforts on the people who do. If you develop your product or service with these people specifically in mind, you will be far more successful than you would be trying to sell your service or product to everyone.

You CANNOT be all things to all people!

If you already have business or idea and you have realized that your marketplace is over crowded, you might try to narrow your focus. For example, if your site sells digital recorders, you may have a lot of competition and find it difficult to get noticed. If you were to narrow your focus to selling exclusive, high-end digital recorders to professional users, you might have a much better chance of success with your home business.
