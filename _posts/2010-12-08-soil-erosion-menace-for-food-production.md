If the increasing population is to be fed with the needed food items, it is a must that we apply our mind to conserve the soil. As we all see, the greed to improve the productivity of the land has led to the soil degradation in various ways. The soil erosion has added to the woe of the agriculture due to the low organic matters, soil compaction and acidity problems. It is found that the water and the wind contribute the excessive soil erosion in various places around the world. In various countries the soil erosion goes slowly without being noticed by the people.

The run off due to the rain fall in the sloppy areas pose a major problem in the matter of soil erosion. The high intensity rain fall in a short period leads to the soil movement with more intensity and the upper layer with the humus is washed off to the waste low lying lands. In fact, many studies have measured the reduction in the soil fertility owing to the soil erosion due to different factors. Unless we give the needed attention to this issue through the contour binding, border planting to act as wind shields and other relevant preventive measures to avoid the soil erosion, the future generation is bound to suffer for want of adequate food.
