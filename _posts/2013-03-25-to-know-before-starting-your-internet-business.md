There are loads and loads of businesses you could start. Thank you so much to the advent of new technology. However, despite the possibilities out there, there are a few essential steps that you have to consider as a new entrepreneur.

1.Do your market research. Just because you have a website and a good product to sell, does not necessarily mean that people will buy from you. One of the first things that you have to consider is to research on your target market. Here are some questions that you need to ask:

- Who needs the product you offer?
  
- Is there a niche?
  
- Who is your ideal customer?

It is essential that these questions be answered even before you consider starting your business. Do not be one of those entrepreneurs who found out too late that there is not enough market for them to capture. Others have realized that their target market was just too limited to make their business work.

2.Show yourself the required money. Both online and offline businesses need start up money or capital. Determine what you currently have, what your business requires and how will you go around getting money if ever you need additional funding. Just to give you a heads up, a business plan will be needed if you plan to borrow money from a financial institution. It is important that your business plan be detailed as possible because this is what you will use to figure out how much money you are going to borrow and lending companies require the presentation of a business plan.

3.Hire a reputable accountant. Having an accountant is something some entrepreneurs do not really look into; they do not realize the importance of these people. The accountant that you will hire should be versed with startup ventures and also make sure he understands the state laws, since every state has its own intricacies. The accountant you will hire is also the best person to advice you on bookkeeping and other record keeping procedures that will help you keep in track for years.

4.Decide on a business name. This is simple and obvious. No one has ever started a business without a name right? Keep in mind that your business name is important for this is how people will address you. The right name says a lot about your company and of course, the people involved as well. It would be advisable if you make a list of potential names and narrow it down to the one that will best describe your company. Remember that your business name should be catchy, easy to pronounce, easy to remember and most of all easy to spell.

5.Procure the necessary permits and licenses. Along with your business license, it is also important that you get additional permits, which of course will depend on the nature of your business and the local laws you are subject to abide. Some areas require additional permits for stuff like liquor, manufacture of goods, etc. research all licenses and permits applicable to your business even if it is online, you are still required to procure permits in order to operate.

These five steps are too important to ignore. Always remember that it is imperative that you start your business on the right foot. Everything will go well of you are equipped with the right knowledge.
