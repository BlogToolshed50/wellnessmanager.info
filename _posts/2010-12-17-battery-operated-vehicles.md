Electric car is the latest technical revelation that is taking place in the automobile industry. Many companies are coming out with electric cars of different variants. As the fuel cost in operating the petrol and diesel version cars have become costly there is growing demand for the recently introduced electric cars. Unlike the petrol driven vehicles the electric cars can run at a speed of 60 to 80 kilo meter per hour. They can be charged at the house itself in the normal line that is available for home consumption. A seven hour recharging will run the vehicle for the full day.

Electric cars are now on the road. In the light of the exorbitant oil price and the increase in the recurring cost of maintaining the petrol and diesel driven vehicle this has come into the market. The sale of petrol driven vehicle has come down drastically. Hence, to improve the sales and to improve the profit, the car makers are now concentrating on manufacturing electric cars. These cars are driven on lithium batteries. The batteries are to be charged after running a particular distance. The speed of such electric cars are restricted to 6o miles per hour. Dutch companies are in the forefront to manufacture such vehicles.

Electric cars are slowly picking up in various countries. Battery operated vehicles are coming to the markets and many car producers are diverting towards this sun rise sector. This has been compelled by the rising fuel cost coupled with the atmospheric pollution due to the use of petroleum driven cars. Small cars with reasonable speed are invented to begin with to suit the road condition and other infrastructures to recharge the energy. Once this sector grows it is going to be very big boom for the human kind as it reduces the cost of maintenance apart from helping the world to minimize the global warming.
