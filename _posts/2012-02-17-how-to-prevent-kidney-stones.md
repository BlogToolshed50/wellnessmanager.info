How to prevent kidney stones, here are some of the things that people can do once they set their minds into it: 

1. Taking in lots of fluid, specifically water. Experts agree that the best way to prevent kidney stones is by flushing it out from the system. And what&#8217;s the best way to do it? By drinking a large amount of liquids, especially water which is free from major impurities. Taking in lots of water everyday—at least 8 glasses or more—will flush out waste products in the body and can hep dilute the minerals or other stone-forming materials such as salts present in the person&#8217;s urine. For those who are already suffering from kidney stones or those that are prone to it, experts say that they should avoid drinking liquids with other components such as sodas and other juices to avoid the fast formation of kidney stones. 

2. Certain modifications in diet. Undeniably, diet plays a huge role in maintaining good health. Keeping the body free from kidney stones will greatly depend on how balanced the diet of that person would be. Majority of kidney stone-sufferers today share the same type of stone—the calcium oxalate stone. As the name suggests, this type of stone can only be developed with too many calcium intakes. Experts say that for people to veer away from kidney stones, they should cut down on foods that are high in calcium and oxalate such as dairy products including leafy vegetables, soda-colas, cranberries, chocolates, and peanuts. These foods—if cannot be totally slashed out from the diet—should be consumed in moderation because these would only make the formation of kidney stones faster. To avoid another type of stone—the uric acid stone—people should cut down on foods that have high animal protein content such as poultry and red wine because these have high purines content. To avoid developing stones made of salts, people should also avoid meals that have high sodium content. People should focus on eating foods that are high in fiber and should also increase their citric acid or vitamin C intake. By doing this, you can your kidney stones would be dissolved in no time due to the citric properties of citrus. 

3. Taking in proper medication. In severe cases of kidney stones, proper medication would help such as thiazide, sodium cellulose phosphate, oral calcium supplement, allopurinol, polycitra K, thiol, D-penicil-lamine, Acetohy-droxamic acid or AHA, and toradol to help relieve kidney pain and reduce the amount of stone-forming materials in the body.
