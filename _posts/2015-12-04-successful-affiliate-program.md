Two Christmases ago I tugged on one of those paper crackers and after a small bang, out popped a piece of yellow paper the size of a credit card.

On one side was a riddle that didn&#8217;t make much sense, but on the other side was an &#8216;Inspirational Quote&#8217; that made a lot of sense.

So much so, that I still have it in my wallet.

This is what it said: &#8220;The shortest and best way to make your fortune is to let people see clearly that it is in their interests to promote yours&#8221;.

I&#8217;m constantly amazed to see affiliate programs that offer 20%, or even as little as 15%, to their affiliates.

It is generally accepted that the production of any information product is only 10 percent of the whole process.

What&#8217;s the other 90 per cent? Marketing!

My own affiliate program gives 50% commissions, and I wouldn&#8217;t dream of offering less. After all, who makes the sale &#8211; me or the affiliate?

It may be disappointing to see 50% of your sale price going to your affiliates. But it&#8217;s worth remembering this: without your affiliate, that sale simply wouldn&#8217;t have occurred.

Of course, there are many other factors involved in building a successful affiliate program, but this is the first and most important: make your affiliates your equal partners, because they&#8217;ll be doing 90% of the work.
