NOTHING IN THE WORLD CAN TAKE THE PLACE OF PERSISTENCE, TALENT WILL NOT, NOTHING IS MORE COMMON THAN UNSUCCESSFUL MEN WITH TALENT.

Charles Swindoll

Persistence is a state of mind and is a direct result of habit. Your are the master of your own fate. Persistence is the key to your success in the ring and in life in general. Nothing beats persistence. The most common cause of failure is the habit of quitting when you are overtaken by “temporary defeat”. Most people quit just steps away towards obtaining there goal, not realizing how close there where if they just hung in there. You are in control of your destiny because you control your thoughts. You choose all the thoughts that enter your mind. So when you think you can’t revisit a former victory that you had. Every obstacle is just a stepping stone towards your success in the ring and outside in the real world, if you choose to learn from your mistakes and persist. Ask yourself honestly how bad you want to achieve that goal i.e. title belt. Here are some tips on gaining persistence in your life.

 Knowing what you want is the first and most important step.

 Have a strong motive and remind yourself of it everyday.

 Gain knowledge from your team members such as coaches and conditioners who will help and push you to become the best fighter you can be.
  
“I AM THE MASTER OF MY FATE, I AM THE CAPTAIN OF MY SOUL.”

William Henley
  
Take an honest look at where you stand with persistence in your fight career and what you need to do to be the best fighter you can be. Talk to people who have gone through those same obstacles and overcame them and ask how they did it. Read biographies on your favorite fighter’s and their obstacles to put perspective on the fact that everyone goes through “temporary defeat”. Remember it’s only temporary it’s your choice if you want to give up and make it into a failure.
