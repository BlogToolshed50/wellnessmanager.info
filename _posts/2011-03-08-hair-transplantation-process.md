Hair transplantation has become handy for those who suffer heavy hair loss. IHair transplantation involves the process of relocating the hair follicles from the dense areas towards the less thick areas. Once the relocation is over, the donor stripe is removed and the area is closed with the help of a stainless steel staple to compact it and secure the same in the place. There are many expert hair technicians who will graft the recipient area to create room for new follicles by employing the latest techniques in the hair transplantation. Hair loss should be treated in the early stage as complete baldness cannot be cured.
