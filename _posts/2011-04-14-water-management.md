According to the prediction of various scientific organizations, the world is going to face water shortage both for Agriculture and consumption of both human and other living creatures in the days to come. In the absence of water conservation, coupled with depleted ground water storage, the problem is bound to aggravate. When the population is increasing phenomenally, we are not bothering to safeguard the available water resources. Increased de forestation too reduced the periodic monsoon rain. The ecological imbalance too resulted in erratic down pour, resulting in devastation and wastage of precious water. Many countries are educating their citizens to go in for water harvesting at their houses to improve the water table in and around. New townships should invariably be insisted to have the water harvesting arrangement in the planning stage itself.
